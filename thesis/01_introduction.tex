\section{Introduction\label{chap:introduction}}
At the beginning of the World Wide Web, \webPage{}s were self-contained. 
And without a lot of effort they still are. 
\\
The content of a \webPage{} which is initially loaded is not changed until a new resource is requested by the user.
One big change brought the invention of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (\ajax{}).
It introduced the possibility to change content without the need of requesting a full new \webPage{} at a different Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
The approach only loading one full \webPage{} initially and then changing its content interactively is called \singlePageApplication{}.
As presented in \cite{jonsson2009database} \singlePageApplication{}s are more user-friendly than the common designs, e.g. due to lower load times and the elimination of interruption time experienced on common \webApplication{}s.
\ajax{} is nowadays, other than mentioned in \cite{jonsson2009database}, available in nearly every browser.
As stated in \cite{herlihy2013howmany} in 2013 only 1.1\% of the internet users visiting the \webSite{} of the UK government did not get their JavaScript enhancements.
\\
As mentioned in \cite{jonsson2009database} a disadvantage ochrome
f \ajax{} is that users are not able to save their \webSite{}s as a bookmark, because while surfing on this page, the URL never changes.
Additionally this lack of URLs for subpages leads to a contradiction to the current HTTP standard as defined in \cite{fielding1999hypertext}.
A resource is defined there as \enquote{a network data object or service that can be identified by a URI}.
A page which can only be accessed by \ajax{} and not via a normal URL does not fulfil this requirement.
\\
Another implication stated in \cite{jonsson2009database} is that the functionality of the back button in browsers is often not given.
Furthermore \cite{estrada2011take} complains that \enquote{...previously seen pages are not always reachable through it}.
Additionally \ajax{} driven \webApplication{}s may require multiple small server calls which might produce performance implications.
\\
\SinglePageApplication{}s have another problem nowadays. 
As mentioned in \cite{matter2008ajax} \ajax{} \webSite{}s are difficult to examine for search engines and other crawlers, due to several challenges.
\\
As Google is the most used search engine in the World Wide Web they have a design pattern, presented in \cite{google2014online}, for implementing a crawlable \ajax{} web application.
In this guideline it is recommended to have snapshots of every \webPage{} available under non-user-friendly \gls{url}s, called Hash-Bang URLs.
This means additional maintenance effort for \webSite{}s, especially when they are very dynamic.
\\
Even though Google can interpret JavaScript-generated content since May 2014, as announced in \cite{hendriks2014understanding}, they still give the advice to degrade graceful when it comes to JavaScript compatibility.
\\
In this thesis we will improve and evaluate the performance of a new technology called \lare{}.
Together with Stephan Gro{\ss} the author developed PJAXR, the predecessor of \lare{}, for using \ajax{} with it's advantages but trying to avoid the disadvantages explained before.
\\
The result of this cooperation was a frontend-side implementation called \emph{jquery-pjaxr}.
As PJAXR also needed a backend to be implemented, the author developed the first PJAXR backend called \emph{django-pjaxr}.
\\
The libraries \emph{\lareJS{}} and \emph{\djangoLare{}} are introduced in this thesis as the successors of \emph{jquery-pjaxr} and \emph{django-pjaxr}.
Additionally in this thesis the author will introduce a new \lare{} backend for PHP, \emph{\phpLare{}} and \emph{\twigLare{}}, an extension for the \twig{}\footnote{\url{http://twig.sensiolabs.org/} (Accessed: June 16, 2015)} template-engine.
\\
Later \lare{} will be evaluated to reveal whether the expectations regarding browser functionality are satisfied.
Furthermore the single user performance will be tested through benchmarks using \curl{} and \selenium{} in combination with the \webdriver{} API, to examine whether \lare{} is faster than normal web requests.
